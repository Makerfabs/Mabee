## Mabee Relay 10A

A Relay module used to control high voltage& big current circuits On/Off. It is a digital normally open switch that controls a relay capable of switching much higher voltages and currents than your normal Arduino boards. When the relay is switched on, the LED will light up and the relay will allow current to flow. The peak voltage capability is 250V at 10A.
